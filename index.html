<div id="d8"><u><b>About me and my Interest</b></u>
<p>From my childhood I loved science.The questions - How a light works? How a fan rotates with electricity? How does a plane fly? Is this magic? made me curious about science. While finding the answers I fall in love with science (except biology). I have to admit that Iam have a lot curiosity (Iam not trying to manifest it as appreciation). Like after giving the SSC I watched a movie about hacking and I wanted to learn hacking. Obviously Iam not a hacker right now but while searching about hacking I got introduced with coding. Without the knowledge of general coding I can't learn hacking so I started learning basic coding like Html,css,js just from YouTube . With that knowledge I made this webpage and I also made a car game(it doesn't work on pc,small screen devices because iam not professional).
some concept of physics blew my mind like Time dilation, length contraction, prediction something etc and that helped me to create a strong bond with physics.
I have also an interest in writing stories. I wrote a story for college magazine but that isn't published yet.
